# Miscellaneous Scripts
I publicly share miscellaneous scripts via this repository, including:
1. [**Glasbey LUT:**](/glasbey) Code to plot Glasbey look-up table in ImageJ. Could be used for other ImageJ look-up tables as needed. See [this post](https://forum.image.sc/t/how-to-preserve-roi-property-color/52969/5) on the ImageJ forum for more information.
